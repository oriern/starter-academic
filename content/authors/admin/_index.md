I a Ph.D. in NLP, focusing on Multi-Document Summarization with Neural Networks. My Ph.D. is under the supervision of Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Jacob Goldberger at Bar Ilan University.

Until recently, I was a Data Scientist at Intel and finished my M.Sc. in Speech Enhancement with Deep Learning. Before Intel, I worked at Mellanox as a firmware engineer.

I like good music and I volunteer at ``Paamonim‚Äù- an organization promoting financial responsibility.
